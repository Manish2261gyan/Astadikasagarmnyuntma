# Astadikasagaranyunatama 🚢– Smart Ship Routing System


Astadikasagaranyunatama is a smart ship routing system developed using Java Spring Boot. It calculates the best possible routes between ports using algorithms like A* , improving fuel efficiency and reducing travel time. Features include port management, route tracking, and real-time map display.

## ✅ Tech Stack:
- Java, Spring Boot
- MySQL
- HTML, CSS
 

## ✅ Key Features:
- 🌐 Add and manage ports with names, latitude, and longitude
- 🗺️ Create route connections (edges) between ports
- ⚡ Find shortest or optimal routes using A* or Dijkstra algorithms
- 📊 Real-time route calculation with clear output
- 🖥️ User-friendly web interface built with HTML, CSS
- 💾 Data storage handled through MySQL database

## ✅ Tech Stack:
- **Backend**: Java, Spring Boot
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap (or JavaScript if used)
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Algorithms**: A*, Dijkstra

## ✅ How to Run:
1. Clone the repository
2. Open project in your IDE (IntelliJ/VS Code)
3. Set up MySQL database and update application.properties
4. Run using Spring Boot
5. Access via browser at `http://localhost:8080/`

## ✅ Purpose:
This project is aimed at helping optimize maritime travel, reduce fuel costs, and minimize travel time by intelligently suggesting best route paths between multiple ports.
